# Social Nostalgia During Economic Strain
An empirical study of how economic pressure influences social trends that are driven by nostalgia in fashion, cinema, and technology.

## Motivation
Economic instability is often accompanied by the return of certain social trends that were prominent in the past. This is most famously noted in the revival of vintage-style clothing, the increased appeal of cinematic reboots, and an uptick in the sales of retro technologies. Such patterns imply that when the ground reality feels unstable, people look to the past for comfort.

This project investigates whether the pattern of the effects of economic strain on the resurgence of social trends driven by nostalgia is reflected in empirical data.

**Research Question:**
What is the impact of economic stress on the revival of older societal trends in fashion, cinema, and technology?
